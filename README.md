# CRP 4280/5280: Mapping and Countermapping
**Fall 2024**  
Cornell University  

## 📌 Course Description  
This hybrid practice-discourse course introduces students to the ideas, debates, and practices in critical cartography and digital geography. How, who, and towards what purposes are spatial relationships represented through maps?  

Throughout the semester, we will approach mapping with an emphasis on the ethos of countermapping to make more legible those perspectives, claims, and epistemologies that are generally underrepresented. We will also discuss how new mapping technologies and novel big data are shifting the mapping landscape, what new tensions and possibilities arise, and how these new tools supplant or reinforce existing power dynamics.  

Students will also “read” and critique maps that speak to each week’s theme in order to understand the design, information, and context surrounding the creation of the map. Alongside our discussions, we will be learning tools and software to create our own web/cloud-based narrative maps and countermaps, with the aim of using these in a final research project of students’ own choosing.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives and Outcomes  
In this course, we will develop tools to build a multi-perspective question, argument, and narrative through map-making. These consist not only of the software, platforms, and code you will learn but also the theory, language, and frameworks that support your research. With this in mind, the core learning objectives are:  

1️⃣ Understand the discourses and tensions in mapping and countermapping epistemologies
3️⃣ Develop foundational skills in web/cloud-based GIS platforms (e.g., Mapbox GL, Felt, CatroDB, etc) and web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS) for interactive mapping. 
4️⃣ Clearly communicate your narrative through mapmaking, contextualization, textual description, and presentation that demonstrates multiple ways of understanding a spatial question in urban development

## 🔍 Prerequisites  
Familiarity with GIS, spatial data formats, and HTML/CSS/JS will help you in the course, but it is not required.  

A laptop is required for the course. Either a Mac or PC is fine, but please make sure you can install software on this laptop. The latest version of QGIS is around 2.91 GB, so ensure your laptop has enough storage. If you have any issues installing the software, as a backup, you can use the lab computers.

## 🏛️ Class Structure  
📅 **Weeks 1-11**: Each week’s class will begin with a **discussion of the week’s topic** on **Tuesday**, followed by a **software lab on Thursday**, where we work through the tools and techniques together.  
- Each week, **one group will lead a discussion** on the required reading and “map readings.”  
- The lab will have both a **tutorial component** and a **more free-form exercise**.  

📅 **Weeks 12-15**: The last four weeks of class will be devoted to **working on and presenting final research projects**. These projects are **of your choosing** and should address a **spatial question in urban development**. The aim is to **synthesize and further develop the skills you have learned throughout the semester**.
